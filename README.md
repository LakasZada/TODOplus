# TODOplus
For the boot.dev hackathon.

TODO plus is a todo list app where you canset a timer for each task and mark the tasks done.

I did as much as I could but I just dont know enough to make a good looking and working app.

# How to Run TODOplus

1.Make sure Python 3.8+ is installed. Then install Pygame by running:

pip install pygame

2.Clone or download the repository with the TODOplus code.

3.run the code with your favorite interperter
